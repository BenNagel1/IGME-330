Audio Effects:
    Bass and Treble were added as audio effects.
    I created two biquad filters, set the values in the data json file, and then made them toggleable using a checkbox on the page.

Sprite Class:
    I created an ellipse class that is used to display two surfboards on the "waves" (visualizer bars).
    The "update" method updates the board's x and y values according to the waves they are attached to.

App Data:
    In the data json file, I added the title of the project, the details of the tracks, and the values for the audio effects.
    These are used for displaying text on the page, in the form of the page title, header, and song list, and adding bass/treble to the audio.

Aesthetics:
    I believe I deserve the full 15%.
    I themed my audio visualizer around the beach/ocean and made additions that presented this to the user.
    
    Here is a list of the changes made to visually enhance my project:
    - Gradient changed to mimic a sunset.
    - Bars now look more like waves and have a gradient to them as well.
    - The pulsing circle looks like a sun.
    - Surf boards were added that follow the wave pattern.
    - A bezier curve pops up to be the sandy beach when the waves do. It also fades away when the other visuals disappear.



Homework 3 Documentation:

I coded this project in TypeScript. In order to make this work, I primarily followed the given steps needed to fix all the errors. There were still many fixes to be made outside of this but they were mostly fixed with similar steps (like for the checkboxes). The only other changes that needed to be made were to the canvas class I made to draw ellipses since it needed explicit typing.
